**EcoExLab** is the attempt to create an easy to use and easy to adapt software for conducting laboratory experiments and simulations in economics or other social sciences with up to date technology.

One of the goals is to connect simulation research with experimental research by both on the same models and software systems. An experiment will then just be an agent-based simulation where the software agents are replaced by real humans in front of a computer screen (or in front of their iPad). And an agent-based simulation will just be an experiment where all or some human agents are replaced by bots (i.e. computer agents).

If this works as intended, then it will solve two problems at the same time: 1) Agent based simulations will very easily be validated empirically. 2) Reproduction of experimentally observed results with computer agents (bots) will allow generating explanatory hypotheses for the observed behavior.

The long-term goal is to provide a complete framework for experimental economics somewhat like the aging z-tree system http://www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/index.php .

The short term goal is to start off with prototyping a particular experiment  to gain experience about how to best structure the software and which technologies to use, before embarking on the development of a general framework.
